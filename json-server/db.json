Kimahri Ronso is a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood. Wakka is a blitzball player and devout follower of the Yevon order. Lulu is a stoic and self-possessed, but well-meaning Black Mage. Auron is a taciturn former warrior monk, and finally Rikku is a perky Al Bhed girl with extensive knowledge of machinery. The primary antagonists of the game are Maester Seymour Guado and the other maesters of the Yevon religion, while the enormous whale-like monster Sin serves as the primary source of conflict.",
